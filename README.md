# Reuqierments
To play this game you have to download DOS-Box emulator and run the exe file from there.
You can download DOS-Box here: https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1
Note:
I decided to include the exe file in the repository so you don't have to link and compile the project by yourself.

## A little bit about the project
I developed this game in 2017 as a semi-final project for school.

## have fun!
